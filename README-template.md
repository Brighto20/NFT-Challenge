## My process
I coded the write ups into HTML & styled it with CSS lastly.
I used BRACKETS code editor to do this task.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learnt how to use flex for the first time(display: Flex). I encountered some difficulties when apply it at the for class= card-details, it is not reflexing, I redo it and gave it new class, it starts working.
I learnt also how align-item works.
